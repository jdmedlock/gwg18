# gwg18 - Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship 2018

## Introduction

In January 2018 I was accepted into [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) _Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship_. 15K scholarships were awarded out of 100K applicants. This provides a three month scholarship to the _Front-End Web Developer_ track and the top 1,500 participants who complete this program will be offered a free six month scholarship for Udacity's _Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree_.

This repo contains my solutions to the coursework. If you have also been awarded this opportunity then Congratulations! However, please abide by Udacity's guidelines regarding original work.
