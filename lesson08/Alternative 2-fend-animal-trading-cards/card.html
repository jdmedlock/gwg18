					These pandas typically grow to the size of a house cat, though their big, bushy
					tails add an additional 18 inches. The pandas use their ringed tails as wraparound 
					blankets in the chilly mountain heights. The red panda shares the giant panda's 
					rainy, high-altitude forest habitat, but has a wider range.
