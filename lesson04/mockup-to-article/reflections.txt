You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  * What new skills have you learned?

    I was already familiar with HTML tags, but my knowledge is quite dated. I found it valuable to learn about challenges
    in various tags, like <strong> vs. <b>, and ways to combine different tags to achieve things like citing references.

  * What has been easy?

    The quiz and project instructions are very clear and easy to follow.

  * What has been difficult?

    Just because the instructions are clear and easy doesn't mean you don't need to read them closely. Forcing myself
    to slow down and review the instructions (more than once) is something I must continually remind myself to do.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

    Paying close attention to the instructions and using MDN to research alternative solutions has been valuable. It
    has also been valuable to weigh the pros and cons of different alternatives to choose the right one for the 
    problem at hand. This means not just finding something that works, but a solution that fits as well.
